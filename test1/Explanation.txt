1. We start by importing necessary libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network.

2. We load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it by normalizing pixel values to be in the range [0, 1].

3. We define the neural network model using the Sequential API, consisting of a Flatten layer to flatten the input images, a fully connected hidden layer with 128 units and ReLU activation, a dropout layer to prevent overfitting, and an output layer with 10 units for classification.

4. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss (suitable for integer labels), and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

5. We train the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs (10 in this case) and validate it on the test data.

6. Finally, we evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and plot the training history for visualization.
