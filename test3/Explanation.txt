1. We create an SQLite database named books.db and define a books table within it.

2. The script defines functions to add, retrieve, update, and delete books in the database. These functions use SQL queries to interact with the database.

3. In the __main__ block, we provide a simple command-line interface for the user to interact with the database. The user can choose from various options to perform database operations.


This structure is chosen because it provides a basic and organized way to interact with a simple database for managing books. The script allows the user to perform all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the books in the database using a user-friendly command-line interface.
